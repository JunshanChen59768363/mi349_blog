        <p>My name is Junshan Chen, I am major in Media and Information, I like drawing, movie, food and calligraphy, recently I have developed a new skill: cooking. Because I live at an apartment now, so I have to make food by myself, but I been enjoy the process of cooking. At first I did not want to cook by myself, it seems like a lot of work, but when I start to cook, I am really into it, I start to learn cooking online with vedios, and my cooking skill improves every time I cook, now I am really confident of the food that I made even I just start cooking 1 month ago. This is a picture of the sky that I took one day in the morning on my way back to my apartment from a class. I really like that morning because it was a very sunny day and I like the sun, the temprature was good, not too cold or hot, a little windy, it was really comfortable, and my day was over, I was going home and relax. The texture of the cloud was very beautiful, that was the reason why I decide to took this picture. I really like this picture. </p>
